Greetings to all dear friends!

The goal of this project is to create a world-class game that showcases the proud history of Cyrus the Great and the grandeur of ancient Persia to the whole world.

Since no Iranian game studios have shown a strong interest in developing such a project, we are taking the initiative ourselves and will move it forward through collaboration.

Continuing this journey alone is very challenging, and we need your help and support! If you have skills in any area (voice acting, modeling, programming, and more) and are interested in contributing, we would be very happy to have you join our team and be part of this great mission.

This game will be completely free and non-commercial. Our sole aim is to present the true glory of Iran, especially at a time when our history is distorted or claimed by others — like the film 300, which portrays an inaccurate image of Iran.

With this game, we intend to reveal the true greatness and splendor of Iran to the world.

Thank you very much for your support!
